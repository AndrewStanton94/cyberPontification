<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
<p>While HTML is a powerful language for creating documents, there are
times when a simpler syntax is sufficient.</p>
<p>Markdown uses symbols to offer a subset of HTML. This has the
benefits of being more concise and readable, even when the symbols
haven’t been converted to a display format.</p>
<p>Markdown covers headers, links, lists, and emphasis. People have
expanded the syntax to include new features, like tables, call-outs and
definition lists.</p>
<p>It’s not a language supported by browsers, but it can be converted to
HTML and an increasing number of websites use this for user provided
content.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of sites showing the syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.markdown-cheatsheet.com/">markdown cheat
sheet</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax">Basic
Syntax</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="regex">RegEx</h2>
<p>Regular Expression (RegEx) is a syntax that allows people to search
for a pattern. Rather than looking for a particular term, you can
specify what characters you want and how many times they should appear.
Describing the shape the data should have.</p>
<p>The simplest search would be a series of letters, numbers, and
spaces. These characters don’t have any special meaning, so they would
work like a basic search. Just be aware that it is case-sensitive by
default. So <code>result</code> is not the same as
<code>RESULT</code>.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-choices">Multiple choices?</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for multiple things, you can tell the regex to look
for <code>this</code> or <code>that</code>. Just use a vertical bar
<code>|</code> to connect the choices. E.g. <code>cat|dog</code>. This
works well by itself if there are a finite number of options.</p>
<h3 id="where-are-you-looking">Where are you looking?</h3>
<p>By default, the regex will take the text you give it and look
everywhere for the pattern. This is a sensible default, but you might
want to narrow it down. You can refer to the start or end of the
input.</p>
<p>Use the caret (<code>^</code>) for the start and (<code>$</code>) for
the end. Taking the URL structure from <a
href="/infrastructure.html">Infrastructure</a>. We can look for secure
URLs by checking the protocol with <code>^https</code> and look for PDFs
with <code>pdf$</code>. However, that won’t include URLs with a query
string.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-characters">Choosing characters</h3>
<p>If you want to capture any character, you can use a full stop
<code>.</code>. This will match a single instance of any character.</p>
<h4 id="make-your-own-group">Make your own group</h4>
<p>You can specify particular characters by listing them inside square
brackets. This will cover all the vowels: <code>[aeiou]</code>.</p>
<p>You can include any character. Just don’t put a caret
(<code>^</code>) as the first character, as this changes the group to
mean anything except these characters. <code>[^aeiou]</code> matches
anything but vowels.</p>
<p>You can also use ranges. So you can get all letters with
<code>[A-Za-z]</code>. This works as computers represent all characters
with numbers, so groups like letters and numbers are stored
sequentially. While you could look for less intuitive sequences to use
as a range, it wouldn’t be recommended.</p>
<h4 id="premade-groups">Premade groups</h4>
<p>These are some shorter representations of common groups so they don’t
need to be redefined each time. Like the caret, you can get the opposite
group. Use the capital version of these letters.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Digits <code>\d</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This covers the numbers [0-9]</p>
</dd>
<dt>Spaces <code>\s</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Representing spaces, tabs and new lines.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Words <code>\w</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A bit misleading, these covers letters, numbers, and underscores. Not
just letters.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="how-many">How many?</h3>
<p>The previous section shows you how to refer to particular characters,
but it only looks for a single instance. How do we get more?</p>
<p>Quantifiers can be explicit numbers, or vaguer categories. By
default, regexes are greedy. They will look for the largest possible
match and reduce until all segments of the regex are used.</p>
<p>There are a few characters that capture some rough quantities.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Asterisk <code>*</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This covers zero or more options. So any number of matches.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Plus <code>+</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This matches one or more occurrences. The thing I’m looking for must
exist.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Question mark <code>?</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This represents zero or one matches. This item is optional.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you want more precise quantities, you can use curly brackets. A
single value can be given <code>{5}</code>, or it can take a minimum and
a maximum <code>{4,6}</code>.</p>
<h3 id="capture-groups">Capture groups</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just use a regex to find a match. Other times, you need
to do something with parts of the match. Wrap the parts of interest in
brackets <code>()</code> and then you can reference them in a
substitution using a dollar and the ordinal number of the capture group.
E.g. <code>$2</code> for the second group.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>One of the simplest regex’s is <code>.*</code>. Which means any
character any number of times. This is useful if you need to capture
everything between other specific items.</p>
<p>This regex will match on an IPv6 segment <code>[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}</code>.
The square brackets describe the characters you want. In this case, the
ranges 0 to 9 and the letters A to F in both upper and lower cases. The
4 in the braces specify how many times you want the preceding group.</p>
<p>If you need to work with regexes then a site like <a
href="https://regex101.com/">regex101</a> is useful as it explains the
regex and allows you to test it against examples. Unless you’re working
with one of the other languages given in the “Flavor” list, choose
<code>ECMAScript (JavaScript)</code>. Screaming Frog is written in Java,
so that’s one exception.</p>
