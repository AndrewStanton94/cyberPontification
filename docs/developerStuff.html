<h1 id="developerstuff">developerStuff</h1>
<p>Here are some terms that you shouldn’t need to worry about but they
might be interesting if you encounter them.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-versioning">Semantic versioning</h2>
<p>When developers need to track version numbers, we tend to use
Semantic Versioning. These are three numbers separated by a full stop.
The first release will be <code>1.0.0</code>. Future updates will
increment one of these numbers depending on the sort of change.</p>
<p>The smallest change is a patch. Representing a correction to the
code. This using the digit on the right. I have fixed a bug, so I
release version <code>1.0.1</code>.</p>
<p>When I add new features, I release either a minor (middle number), or
major (left number) version. The differentiating factor is if the change
is breaking.</p>
<p>A minor (non-breaking) change means that the new version will be
compatible with the previous versions. We get new features and the
current ones won’t (intentionally) break. This becomes release
<code>1.1.1</code>.</p>
<p>A major (breaking) release will be more disruptive. Some parts of the
code won’t work in the same way as they used to, and this will require
changes by people using this code. This breaking change is
<code>2.0.0</code></p>
<p>The major/minor version difference is the most obvious in APIs or
software that is used by other programs. For applications with users,
the major version could be for scheduled releases or to denote a major
UI change.</p>
<h2 id="code-stuff">Code stuff</h2>
<h3 id="libraries-and-frameworks">Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
<p>These are both bundles of code that can be added to your project to
make things easier. This code already exists, and if there’s a community
around it, that shows other people see the benefits from it. They have
hopefully already found and fixed the bugs that you would otherwise
encounter by making your own solution.</p>
<p>The difference between these terms is that a library offers a set of
tools you can pick from. This is helpful to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Whereas a framework tends to solve a particular problem in a
particular way. As long as their method makes sense to you, and you can
follow their structure, this can offer a significant speed-up.</p>
<h3 id="linters-formatters-and-minifiers">Linters, formatters, and
minifiers</h3>
<p>These are some tools developers use when writing code.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Linters</dt>
<dd>
<p>These review the code for known issues. Highlighting them explicitly
before they cause problems while running.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Formatters</dt>
<dd>
<p>Using formatters ensures that the code looks the same across the
project. This consistency helps during code review and saves people
debating the layout rather than what the code does.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Minifiers</dt>
<dd>
<p>These compress the code down to reduce size when sending it to the
client. They remove all unneeded spaces and can rename variables to make
them shorter.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="git">Git</h2>
<p>Git is a version control system, used to track changes in code (or
other text based projects). It was created by Linus Torvalds, the
initial developer of the Linux kernel: The core of the superior
Operating System.</p>
<p>Git allows people to collaborate on code. The project is called a
repo (repository). Each developer <code>clone</code>s the repository to
their machine from a remote source.</p>
<p>People work independently on their own local copies of the repo.
Changes are saved as snapshots called <code>commits</code>. They include
instructions for git to update the code (a <code>diff</code>), and a
description of the changes for users to understand the purpose of the
commit.</p>
<p>It is important to keep your code in sync with other collaborators.
You <code>pull</code> down their changes and <code>push</code> your
commits back up. If others have made changes to the same code, you get a
<code>merge conflict</code> which has to be resolved manually.</p>
<p>When working on complex projects, <code>branch</code>es are helpful.
These allow you to work on new features or bug fixes separately, and
then <code>merge</code> your commits back in once they are complete. You
may have to do a <code>pull request</code> before your branch can be
merged in. This allows code to be reviewed by other collaborators
first.</p>
<h3 id="github">GitHub</h3>
<p>The collaborative nature of Git requires a place to store the code.
While developers could pull changes from each other’s computers, this
requires them to be turned on at the same time and reachable over the
network/internet. So the simplest solution is to have a server that
everyone uses. The most popular site for this is GitHub.</p>
<p>GitHub hosts the code, it also offers an issue tracker and some basic
project management tools. GitHub pages allow you to host a static
website. There is also GitHub Actions which can run tasks. Either on a
schedule or in response to changes to the repo. This can be used to run
automated testing on the new commits.</p>
<h2 id="docker-and-kubernetes">Docker and Kubernetes</h2>
<p>An issue with a team developing an application is the need to have a
consistent environment. Different Operating Systems and program versions
could lead to different results. And this is likely to be different from
where the code runs in production.</p>
<p>Virtual machines were a good starting point, as this allowed people
to work with a more consistent environment. However, they are rather
resource intensive as they have to simulate everything from the hardware
up.</p>
<p>Containers are more efficient as they only have to simulate things
from the Operating System up. By using a Dockerfile, you can choose an
existing docker image (a template for the operating system that’s ready
to run) and run additional commands on top of it to produce a docker
image that is configured for your situation.</p>
<p>Kubernetes (Abbreviated as K8s, the Greek word for helmsman) is a
container orchestration tool. You specify how many containers you want
running, and Kubernetes will start them up and keep them running.
Replacing any broken instances as needed.</p>
