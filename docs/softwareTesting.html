<h1 id="softwaretesting">softwareTesting</h1>
<p>Testing is a process for checking that your software works as
expected. There are multiple stages and types that can (and should) be
used.</p>
<p>I’ve listed a few types here. If you want an overwhelming list, check
out <a
href="https://www.guru99.com/types-of-software-testing.html">Types of
software testing (100 examples)</a></p>
<h2 id="unit-testing">Unit testing</h2>
<p>Developers write these tests to ensure their code is behaving
correctly at the lowest levels.</p>
<p>These tests should be automated so that they can be run easily and
breakages can be discovered as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="integration-testing">Integration testing</h2>
<p>This is used to ensure that the self-contained units of code will
work together. This can be an issue if different teams are working on
the code in parallel and there may be different assumptions.</p>
<h2 id="exploratory-ad-hoc-testing">Exploratory (ad-hoc) testing</h2>
<p>The tester tries to use the system and sees what issues occurs. With
experienced testers, this is a good way to discover defects without the
process and documentation that other methods require.</p>
<h2 id="functional-testing">Functional testing</h2>
<p>Functional testing uses a test plan to describe what a system should
do as a series of requirements.</p>
<p>Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is a popular structure for these
tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given [initial context and setup]<br />
When [something happens]<br />
Then [expected result]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a functional test fails, the BDD structure helps with bug reports.
This should also include a description of the expected and the actual
results.</p>
<h3 id="system-testing">System testing</h3>
<p>Does it work on the expected hardware? This is also known as
Configuration testing when multiple combinations are tested.</p>
<h3 id="end-to-end-testing">End-to-end testing</h3>
<p>This describes a user journey through the system. Can a use achieve
their goals using the site?</p>
<h2 id="non-functional-testing">Non-functional testing</h2>
<p>This is a broad category of tests that aren’t covered by the
functional requirements. They are equally important as the functional
tests, but it can be more challenging to specify what is good enough up
front.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>This ensures that everyone can use the product. This is essential as
alienating users with an unusable site is a bad move, and it’s a legal
requirement.</p>
<p>On the web, accessibility can be increased by the use of semantic
HTML (with supporting technologies like ARIA) to provide maximum clarity
for accessibility software to communicate with users. Colour contrast is
another important consideration.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>This looks for ways the site could be compromised. This is a priority
for any site that handles any personal or sensitive data, but any site
breach is bad for the business.</p>
<p>Attackers could just vandalise the site, causing damage and
data-loss, or they could subtly alter data, making the site less
attractive than the competitors.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Your site does everything it needs to do safely and accessibly, but
how many people can use the site at the same time?</p>
<p>Performance tests check that the site can handle the expected number
of users. This can check how the site handles prolonged usage, and also
rapid increases, which requires the site to scale up quickly.</p>
<h3 id="user-acceptance">User Acceptance</h3>
<p>Hopefully the early stages of the project will have accurately
captured all the requirements and these have been implemented as
designed. This testing validates this assumption and checks if the users
are happy with the product.</p>
